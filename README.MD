# Screenshots Client

This repository contains the source code for my screenshots client.<br>
You need to have a server that has the [api](https://github.com/Fumaz/Screenshots-API) up and running.<br>
You also need to have `flameshot` installed.

### How to use

Simply run `screenshot.sh`. I suggest creating a shortcut to bind your print screen key to the bash script.<br>
The image url will be copied directly to your clipboard.
